        <h2>Answers to Questions:</h2>
        <p class="bolder">What should you focus on during class and after class? </p>
        <p>Spending much time making the activities look good might not be efficient in this class. If the activities or engagements were given deadline on a particular day, focus on aswering the questions being asked because all of those questions will make you become familiar of every tags and styles used in the class. After engagements, there are projects that will be given to work. This will be the next focus, it requires you to apply certain lessons and principle during the engagement activities. These are the things that needs to be focused in this class.</p>
        <p class="bolder">What is the main difference between CSS Grid and CSS Flex?</p>
        <p>The differece of these to grid styles in css is the way how they are used and its function towards the page's customization. CSS Grid will provide you a complete 2D manipulation of the grid of a certain block. It will give you a control towards the columns and rows. On the other hand, the CSS Flex is a 1-dimensional type of grid customization which means, you can either choose to customize the columns or the rows. This is mostly applied in customizing the navigation bar of the page.</p>
