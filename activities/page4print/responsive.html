        <h1>Answers to Questions:</h1>
        <p class="strong">Why do we need a viewport meta tag?</p>
        <p>The viewport meta tag in the HTML is found in the uppermost part of the HTML or inside the head tag. This means that every HTML format nowadays has this feature. We need the viewport meta tag because it is essential in the spacing behavior of the page. The viewport meta tag controls and manipulates the spacing varying in different devices such as desktop computers, laptops, smartphones and other devices that has access to view a certain website.</p>
        <p class="strong">When you select the same tag twice, and in one of them you say "flex-direction: column;" and the other says "flex-direction: row;", which one takes priority?</p>
        <p>When you called the same tag twice, the priorities will be changed. In the CSS, the latest calling of the tag will always be the priority. It doesn't matter how many times you've edited and called it before. Once you called it in the latest history of the CSS customization, it will take that latest calling as the priority and those customization you've done in that specific order.</p>
        <p class="strong">How do you change the CSS for a web page displayed on a phone?</p>
        <p>You can change and customize the aesthetic looks of the page in every devices and their specific pixel size through the media tag in CSS. The media tag will precisely act as a boundary identifier and change the format if the boundary conditions are reached and apply the new set of CSS customization in order to have a pleasing webpage through different pixel sizes and devices.</p>
