        <p class="strong">1. Why is the viewport meta tag important?</p>
        <p>The viewport meta tag in the HTML is found in the uppermost part of the HTML or inside the head tag.

        <p class="strong">2. How can you adjust the CSS for printing?</p>
        <p>The most efficient way to adjust the CSS for printing is first, create another CSS file, naming it as what you prefer. After creating the CSS File, link it in the html or inside the header alongside the CSS File link. After these procedures, you can now differentiate the two by adding a media=" " inserting one as screen and the other CSS File you just created as media="print". This will now be customizable in order for others to print your web efficiently while maintaining the aesthetic look of your webpage in the internet</p>
