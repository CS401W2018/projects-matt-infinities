        <h2>Answers to Questions:</h2>
        <p class="bolder">What are the positives and negatives of hosting your videos on YouTube?</p>
        <p>The positives of hosting my videos on YouTube is that I don't have to worry about storage limits and uploading it to GitHub. Since I am directly linking the embedded iframe of the video from YouTube, it requires no need of storage in the GitHub server. However, the downside for this is that if it is not paid video or has an ads on it, it might redirect you to a video to your possible internet website competitor which you don't control of because YouTube itself is business.</p>
        <p class="bolder">What is the most useful thing you can do with a transform?</p>
        <p>The most thing I can do with transform in CSS is that the appealing attribute it has to offer for the visitors and users. Tranform is one responsible for transitions, interactive User Interface, and aesthetic movement of elements without affecting the document itself.</p>
        <p class="bolder">How do you stay safe online?</p>
        <p>I can stay safe online by simply making sure that the website URL I am in or going to come in has the protocol "HTTPS" where "S" stands for secure. This attribute encrypts all of the communication that has been travelling from source to the server and back. However, even though it is encrypted, there are still evil dudes that will try their best to unencrypt those data. We can prevent this by offering CA certification aauthority which is responsible for providing the user and the server a public key and a private key. These two keys plays a huge role to have a secure communication because if someone who wants to do something evil trying to spy or take information during the communication process, if they don't have aany keys with them, they can't decrypt or decode the data, only those who has the authority and the keys were able to take the data decrypted however, it will take more than a hundred years for a supercomputer to finish this process of decrypting.</p>
        <p class="bolder">What is the schedule for the rest of the class?</p>
