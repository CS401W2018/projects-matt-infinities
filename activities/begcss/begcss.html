        <p style="color: black;"><strong>Explain the difference between inline, embedded, and external CSS.</strong></p>
        <p>Inline CSS is a part of HTML, it can be applied using HTML through the use of <code>style</code> attribute. The Embedded CSS can also be navigated in the HTML, however this is found inside the <code>style</code> tag of the head tag, all other customization for embedded CSS should always be found in the <code>head</code> tag. The external CSS works differently between these three. From the word external, this type of customization has its own <code>.css</code> file that should be linked inside the <coode>head</coode> tag of the HTML in order for it to be applied to the page.</p>
        <br>
        <p style="color: black;"><strong>Explain why you should only use external CSS.</strong></p>
        <p>As what have been discussed in the class earlier. HTML and CSS works the same as how Engineer and Architect works together. Engineer is the one who's responsible for structural stability of the building. The Architect on the other hand is the one who's responsible for aesthetic qualities of a building. The same with HTML and CSS. The HTML is mainly focused on the structural attributes of the webpage, and the CSS is mainly focused on the style of the webpage. Therefore, if problems will raise, a developer already have the idea which should be fixed because they are working separately but in unison.</p>
        <br>
        <p style="color: black;"><strong>What is a selector used for?</strong></p>
        <p>Selecter works best for customizing a specific part of HTML tags. For example, a developer wants to change the color of the h1 tags only, then the developer will use the input <code>h1 {attributes the developer wants to customize}</code> By doing so, all of the h1 will follow the customization style that the developer have edited the h1 using the Selector in CSS.</p>
