        <h2>Answers to Quesitons:</h2>
        <p class="bolder">The form tag has an "action" attribute. What does it do?</p>
        <p>The form tag that has an "action" attribute will lead the visitor and user of the page to another page you linked with your form tag using the action. For example, this page I have, it has a form tag with an action redirecting you to another website which is called processing.html, however since don't have the page yet, it says that file not found. That's how the aaction tag inside the form works.</p>
        <p class="bolder">The form tag has a "method" attribute. What does it do?</p>
        <p>A form tag with a method attribute will help your page customize how it communicates with the server. There are two types of method, get and post.</p>
        <p class="bolder">What is the difference between a "POST" and a "GET"?</p>
        <p>There is a wide difference in these two. The Get will tell the server that the data entered and transfered is via URL, it means that whatever you entered in the form, it will show it to the URL. This is effective for researches and sharing because it will give you the accurate information you entered in the form so others can have the same results as what you have entered. The post on the other hand works privately, this is commonly use for pages with sensitive information such as password, personal information, etc. This method will communicate with the server by sending the data on the background without showing it in the URL.</p>
