        <p class="bolder center">When should you use a background image, and when should you use the IMG tag?</p>
        <p class="center">In this two situations, the use of image varies through its functionality. background image in css or img tag in html. The thing is that if you're going to us it just as a background to add aesthetic concept without affecting the content, you should use the background image in the CSS becuase using this, it will give you more control of the photo especially how you would like it to look like in the webpage. On the other hand, using the img tag in html will affect the SEO level of the content of your webpage. In this case, if the image is a part of your page, then it is better to use the img tag because it will ask you for the alternative of your image for it to become accessible for everyone. Just remember that if it is going to be a part of your content or has something important to do with your page then go use the img tag in HTML, then if it is for aesthetic purpose only, then use background image in CSS.</p>
