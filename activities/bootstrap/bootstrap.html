        <p class="bolder">Can you use Bootstrap on your final project?</p>
        <p>No, Bootstrap can't be use in the project. As a student we are learning so that in the future we might be able to provide our idea in an open-source platform such as the Bootstrap. For now, we need to learn and not copy paste the one being created by others from the Bootstrap.</p>
        <p class="bolder">How can you stay safe online?</p>
        <p>I can stay safe online by simply making sure that the website URL I am in or going to come in has the protocol "HTTPS" where "S" stands for secure. This attribute encrypts all of the communication that has been travelling from source to the server and back. However, even though it is encrypted, there are still evil dudes that will try their best to unencrypt those data. We can prevent this by offering CA certification aauthority which is responsible for providing the user and the server a public key and a private key. These two keys plays a huge role to have a secure communication because if someone who wants to do something evil trying to spy or take information during the communication process, if they don't have aany keys with them, they can't decrypt or decode the data, only those who has the authority and the keys were able to take the data decrypted however, it will take more than a hundred years for a supercomputer to finish this process of decrypting.</p>
