    <p class="bolder">What kind of photos are good to encode using JPEG?</p>
    <p>Pictures with great colors and saturation would best fit in using JPEG. This type of format is commonly used by photographers because it has good quality and balance between colors and binding it together in a small amount of storage.</p>
    <p class="bolder">What kind of photos are good to encode using GIF?</p>
    <p>Images that has fewer colors will be the best once to use in GIF. GIF is an animation of frames that will then compressed to form a segment and sequence of frames. Therefore, having a low color quality image such as JPEG could best fit this format.</p>
    <p class="bolder">What is unique about the PNG format?</p>
    <p>Unlike to JPEG format, PNG on the other won't loss a quality every time you compress it. It will retain its quality no matter how many times you compress the image. It is also capable to have a transparent background giving it a flexible use for graphic arts and multimedia usage.</p>
    <p class="bolder">How do you resize your photo to the size it should be displayed?</p>
    <p>To resize the image. There are applications and software available in resizing images, however the paint application installed in every windows PC is the easiest one to use. You just need to open the image through the paint app then once it is opened, you can resize it using the size window and choose pixels to resize it in pixels ratio. After doing this, you will have a fine looking resized image. Just make sure that the size of the image will match the webpage because there might be issues in showing the image in the page. If it is still too big, the page may not be able to show the full image.</p>
    <p class="bolder">Why should you resize photos using photo editing software instead of resizing it using CSS?</p>
    <p>Resizing the photo you are going to link in the page is a practical way for you and for the visitors because they could save more in storing and downloading the image. It can also benefit the loading time of the page because large images could take time to also load the page. It will also affect how the page presents the image. If it's too big, the page may not be able to show the full image, if it's to small, the image may not be visible in the page.</p>
