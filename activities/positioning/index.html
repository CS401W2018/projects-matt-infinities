        <p class="bolder">What is normal flow in HTML?</p>
        <p>Normal flow in HTML can also be referred as the default alingment of every element we put in the HTML. For example, we add inline tags in our page. Those inline tags has their own default alignment that will takeover throughout the page. This kind of technique is practiced without the application of any positiong procedure from the CSS.</p>
        <p class="bolder">What does float do? Why do you need to clear the float?</p>
        <p>The float will let an element of the page share a space with its nearby sibling element. It can be either left, middle, or right then the other element will take share space on the opposite side of the floated element.</p>
        <p class="bolder">What do absolute, fixed, and relative do?</p>
        <p>The absolute postion will make a certain block or image take the space of its older sibling. The relative postion will make an element acquire its actual space given in the configuration. The fixed on the other hand, will take its own space above every element. It will float all over the website which can be useful in creating sidebar.</p>
        <p class="bolder">How can you make nice navigation buttons for mobile devices?</p>
        <p>To make a nice looking navigation buttons, it should be configured well in the CSS part. It can be customized by entering <code>nav a</code> to edit it. Change the display into block so that it will become a shape and solid so that wherever you click the box it will redirect you to the link. You may also want to change the background color to make it visible and change the borders to make it aligned.</p>
        <p class="bolder">Where can you find videos to review what we talked about in class?</p>
        <p>There were various ways to watch tutorial videos in this class. Majority of the videos can be found in the lecture notes section in every chapter of this class. If there are specific topic that you want to have an answer, you can watch a video specific to the topic you want. There are videos attached in some of the lessons. These ways can be very helpful in learning HTML and CSS.</p>
