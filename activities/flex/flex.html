        <p class="bolder">What you learned about Flex and CSS.</p>
        <p>I have learned that the flex is very important because it is aethetically pleasing to view a website where you can find it well organized and aligned efficiently. CSS Flex satisfies all of the needs we have in customizing our website especially in spaces, it is highly manipulative and it has access to let you control of the spacing in your website. Overall, it is the way to make your website aethetically pleasing to the visitors.</p>
        <p class="bolder">Why do you need to have an accessible website? What does that mean?</p>
        <p>Accessible website will make the viewers and visitors become satisfied or might not be able to do something to access your website. They might only have a short time to navigate  and or unable to tour on your website. Making a webpage accessible means making it efficiently effective to every viewers regardless of their circumstances. You should be mindful of all possibilities just for everyone will have the opportunity to access your webpage.</p>
