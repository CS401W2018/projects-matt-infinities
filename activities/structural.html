        <p><strong>What goes in the header?</strong></p>
        <p>Navigation tags, logo, and other links to the same page are those tags that should be inside the header.</p>
        <p><strong>What goes in the Nav? Can the Nav go in the header? Does it have to go in the header? Does the Nav contain links to another website?</strong></p>
        <p>About Us, Account, Login or Sign-up, Home Page, Search Hub, and Blog are those that should be in a navigation tag. Nav tag can either go inside of the header or outside, it won't really matter because nav can work on its own. Nav tag <strong>doesn't have to go</strong>inside the header, you put it inside or outside depending on your preference. Nav tags may contain an external link leading to another webiste, but it is recommended to have links that would redirect the audience to your own page and not to other's pages.</p>
