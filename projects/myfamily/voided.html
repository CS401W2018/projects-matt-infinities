                        <p>Chief Tui is Moana's father. He is a highly protective and a responsible father for Moana and to his family. Aside of being a responsible father, the whole village also relies in his authority because he has the control to both rules, and the army of the village. He is also taking watch of the village, he protects the village from the dangerous elements of the island and beyond the reefs. Overall, his trait is more of being a protective father and a leader of their nation.</p>
