        <h3 class="center ">Childhood Games</h3>
        <p>It all started with a game against my eldest brother. It was his training night with his coach and trainer when I chose to play against him. He was so good in playing it since he played it with formality. At first, I was just playing it in a casual playstyle however, when I'm 10 years old, I discovered my passion in this sport. I always play with my brother every after his training but I always lost every game. I also played against my childhood friends at all cost, rain or shine, night and day. My competitive mindset always telling me that I could get better if I could just play it casually.</p>
        <h3 class="center">Early Competitive Games</h3>
        <p>I was in 5th grade when I first played my competitive match. It was against an experienced elementary student to play competitively. Despite of formality of playstyle he has, my mind always reminds me of having hours of casual playtime is <span ID="emphasis">not bad against a good player</span>. It was a tough game for me, however it was a shocking experience that I have won against that player. I didn't expect I could that match. Since then, my passion towards playing badminton competitively grows unprecedentedly.</p>
        <h3 class="center">Higher Level Competition</h3>
        <p>When I got to highschool, my passion towards badminton grows quickly. I have the courage to attend workshops, joined training seesions with others, and maintaining my fitness. I always grab the opportunity to join every competition in our place. I won different levels of comptetion and kept competing division to division. I can say that this is the peak of my interest to badminton.</p>
        <h3 class="center">Senior High Life</h3>
        <p>It was this 2 years that everything have changed. I realize the importance of education and eventually to serve a mission after graduating. I entered a pretigious school where I started to dedicate my works and efforts to my academic standing. It was also the time that I commit myself in missionary preparation while studying. I almost forgot everything about badminton. This is the flow of my interest in playing badminton. I'm still playing it casually here at BYU-Hawaii just to have fun and <span ID="emphasis">keep myself physically fit</span>.</p>

            <li ID="coloremp">I used the color with hex code #422714 to emphasize my texts.</li>
            <li class="answer1">I used the color with hex code #744E34 to de-emphasize my texts.</li>
            <li>I only used my own preference to choose the color. For this web page, I used an complementary color style scheme which means I have 2 opposite colors in the color wheel and I only adjust their shade and not the saturation.</li>
