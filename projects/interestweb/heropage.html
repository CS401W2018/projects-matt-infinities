        <p>Since his 2008 movie Ironman, I was really impressed about his knowledge of how things works. Throughout the Marvel series, he never disappointed every expectations I had. His inventions and <span ID="emphasis">dedication in learning</span> made him a unique hero from others that I've ever known. These are the inventions that impressed me in his Marvel fictional life.</p>

            <dt class="bolder">Arc Reactor</dt>
            <dd>It is a reactor that was generated by fission reaction and serves as a powerful energy source of his armor and weapon system.</dd>
            <dt class="bolder">Time Heist Machine</dt>
            <dd>It as a machine that will bring you to your smallest atomic scale to explore quantum realm. This will then help you find specific wormhole to jump to different timelines in multiversal scale.</dd>
            <dt class="bolder">Nanotechnology</dt>
            <dd>One of the most innovative invention he has during his fictional career. This kind of technology uses nanomites to help upgrade his efficiency and armor strength. This massively increases his performance against every villain starting from Infinity War till Endgame.</dd>
