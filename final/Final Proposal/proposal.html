        <p class="bolder">The title and topic of your site.</p>
        <p>I come up with a title "Perfume Explorer". From the title I just generated, I want my website to be informative. This includes a brief information about different types of scents, ingredients, duration, and different personality that an audience might have. The goal of this website is to help the audience know the scent that would suit their personality and activity. It will give information from the perfume itself to the person that is interested in perfumes.</p>
        <p class="bolder">A brief paragraph about why you choose this topic.</p>
        <p>I chose this topic becuase I also have an experience when I was also finding the right scent for me, based on what I want and that would really suit my personality. This topic will not be as accurate as others do, however this website will help them acknowledge the importance of matching the perfume into their acitivities and personality so it will be effective to use. I was also overwhelmed to the situation of choosing hich scent and ingredient I should choose because there's a lot of choices and it varies differently, therefore I just want to help my audience in a little to huge help for them to know what scent that really suits them.</p>

        <p class="bolder">How will you collect information/images/content for your site? You need at least 5 references on your site, list out at least 2 of references you plan on using.</p>
        <p>For the information, it will mostly come from the Google with verified information which excludes the "Wikipedia", I will then paraphrase it and give credit for the author to avoid plagiarism. For the images, I will also use the Google and find there the one that is safe to use for this purpose without increasing the risk of being sued, this can be done by filtering the images in the Google image tools into "Creative Commons Licences".</p>
        <p class="bolder">Include a statement acknowledging that you have read the warnings below.</p>
        <p>I, Matthew Leoncio have acknowldge and read the warnings below. This proves that I have read them and will apply it through the making and submitting the Final Project.</p>

        <p class="bolder">WARNING!!!</p>
        <p>You CAN NOT copy and paste any text from another website (especially Wikipedia), except with small quotes with attribution given. You will get an AUTOMATIC F for the final project and presentation if you do. Most of your site should be your own content.</p>
        <p>You CAN NOT use copyrighted pictures or other information. All pictures must be owned by you or licensed to be used on your site, and attribution must be given if required. You will lose 30 points for each copyrighted picture you use.</p>
        <p>You CAN NOT just copy another site. Your site must be mostly your original work.</p>
        <p>You CAN NOT copy another student's final project or page and change the text. The HTML and CSS must be your own work. Copying HTML and CSS is cheating, and it will result in an automatic F in the course. You will also be turned in to the honor code office.</p>
        <p>I will not use ChatGPT or another AI system to generate HTML, CS, or content on my page.</p>
